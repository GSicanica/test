# Website Files

This repository contains the output of the NameSilo website builder. All files under `public_html/` are served by PHP on the hosting platform.

## Deployment

The `.cpanel.yml` file defines simple deployment instructions for cPanel. Running cPanel's Git deployment will synchronize the `public_html/` directory to the web root.

## Notes

Most of the code under `public_html/sitepro/` is generated by the site builder and is not intended for manual editing. If you need to modify the site, consider using the NameSilo site builder interface and redeploy the generated files.
