# Website Source

This repository contains the exported contents of a SitePro website.

- **public_html** – document root of the site. Everything in this folder is copied to the web server.
- **.cpanel.yml** – defines automatic deployment when pushed to cPanel.

## Deploying to cPanel

The `.cpanel.yml` file defines a few tasks:

```yaml
deployment:
  tasks:
    - export DEPLOY_PATH=/home/tmbv80639337/public_html
    - mkdir -p $DEPLOY_PATH
    - rsync -av --delete ./public_html/ $DEPLOY_PATH/
```

When you push changes, cPanel will sync `public_html` to `$DEPLOY_PATH` on your hosting account. Adjust `DEPLOY_PATH` if your account uses a different path.

## Updating SitePro Content

The `public_html/sitepro` directory was generated by the SitePro builder. To make changes or rebuild the site:

1. Open the SitePro editor provided by your hosting provider.
2. Import the existing project if needed, or start from your original SitePro project files.
3. After publishing/exporting from SitePro, replace the contents of `public_html/sitepro` with the new export.
4. Commit and push the updated files so deployment can run.
