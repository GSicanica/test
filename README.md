# SitePro Test Website

This repository hosts a website generated with **NameSilo SitePro**. The deployed files live under `public_html/` and are copied to the server via the `.cpanel.yml` deployment script.

## Deployment

The `.cpanel.yml` file defines cPanel deployment tasks:

```yaml
deployment:
  tasks:
    - export DEPLOY_PATH=/home/<account>/public_html
    - mkdir -p $DEPLOY_PATH
    - rsync -av --delete ./public_html/ $DEPLOY_PATH/
```

Pushing to the default branch triggers these tasks on the hosting account.

## Development

The pages inside `public_html/sitepro` were generated by the SitePro builder and many PHP files have hashed names. The original, humanâ€‘readable PHP modules are available under `src/` (mirrored from `public_html/sitepro/src`). Modify these sources and rebuild the site in SitePro to regenerate the optimized output.

To customize or add pages manually, edit the files inside `public_html/`. After committing, redeploy via cPanel.
