# Website Source

This repository contains the deployment-ready `public_html` directory generated by the NameSilo Website Builder.

The unminified PHP sources used by the builder live under `src/`. Changes to PHP logic should be made in this directory.

## Building

1. Ensure `php` is available in your environment.
2. Run `./scripts/build.sh` to strip comments and whitespace and copy the results into `public_html/sitepro/src`.
3. Deploy using the `.cpanel.yml` tasks or your preferred method.
